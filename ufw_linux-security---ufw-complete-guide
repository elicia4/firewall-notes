UFW is a utility that is designed to simplify the setup and management of 
firewall rules, more specifically iptables rules. UFW allows you to easily 
and succinctly control you various firewall rules. The main tool UFW uses 
to do this is iptables. To get more context on what it does and how it's 
used:

    man ufw 

UFW is a service. You can start them, stop them, restart them, enable them to 
run on startup and so on. Make sure you DO NOT enable the service before you 
configure your firewall because you can lose access to it. To view the status of
your firewall:

    sudo ufw status

The default UFW configuration file is located in /etc/default/ufw . To disable
the service you can run:

    sudo ufw disable

It's always recommended when setting up a firewall, especially one on a server,
to set up everything from scratch because it's these types of rules that can 
really cause an issue. To start fresh, reset:

    sudo ufw reset

Don't worry, by default the program will back everything up before resetting.

You can get started by setting up the default policies. This is recommended for
every new configuration. The default policies are as follows:

    1) deny incoming connections 
    2) allow outgoing connections

The commands are:

    sudo ufw default deny incoming
    sudo ufw default allow outgoing

If outgoing connections don't work, you can diable the service completely:

    sudo systemctl stop ufw 

You disable everything, you set your rules and then you activate it. 

The next to understand is what services you want to keep active in regards to
incoming and outgoing connections and what services you want to prevent from 
being accessed. Imagine that you want http/https and ssh to work. To allow them
run:

    sudo ufw allow ssh OR sudo ufw allow 22
    sudo ufw allow http 
    sudo ufw allow https 

If you want to allow ftp:

    sudo ufw allow ftp
    
And so on and so forth. If you want to allow a particular connection from an IP
address explicitly:

    sudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.1

To deny all ssh connections except from one IP address:

    sudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.1 to any port 22

You can also specify an entire subnet:

    sudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.1/24 to any port 22
    
Make sure that when you set up individual IP addresses that they are static. If
they are dynamic, things are going to break because your addresses will change.

To start and enable a service at the same time:

    sudo systemctl enable --now ufw 
	sudo ufw enable
